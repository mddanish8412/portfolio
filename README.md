## 🎨 Design Choices

### 1. Theme
The chosen theme is a **Modern & Clean Web Developer Portfolio**.  
The goal was to create a **professional and visually appealing layout** that is easy to navigate and highlights key information.

### 2. Color Scheme
A **dark-mode theme** was selected for a modern and focused look:
- **Primary Background:** `#1a1a2e` (Dark Charcoal)  
- **Secondary Background / Cards:** `#16213e` (Navy)  
- **Accent Color:** `#00f5c8` (Bright Cyan / Teal for buttons, links, and highlights)  
- **Text Color:** `#e3e3e3` (Off-White for readability)  

### 3. Typography
Two fonts were chosen from **Google Fonts** for a clean and balanced hierarchy:
- **Headings (`h1`, `h2`, `h3`):** `Poppins` – Modern and geometric sans-serif  
- **Body Text (`p`):** `Roboto` – Highly readable and neutral sans-serif  

### 4. Layout
The layout is built using **semantic HTML5** for clarity and accessibility.  
- **Flexbox** and **CSS Grid** were used to create a **responsive structure**.  
- Includes sections like **Hero, About, Skills, Projects, and Contact**.  
- JavaScript handles **mobile navigation toggle** and basic interactivity.
